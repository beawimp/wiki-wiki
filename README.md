Wiki-Wiki - A WordPress Wiki!
=============================

This plugin has come to out of the frustration I've had with existing wiki plugins for WordPress.

There are some out there that work, but have a lousy implementation (in my opinion) or just flat out don't work/shotty dev work. I built this specifically for beawimp.org, but figured why not open source it and send it out to the masses?

THE PLUGIN IS IN ALPHA.
-----------------

It is strongly urged that the use of this plugin, at this stage, is not encouraged. Wait for the beta release will ya? :)
