Add a wiki to WordPress

== Description ==

**Another WordPress Wiki?**
Yup. In my opinion, all the other Wiki plugins for WordPress were clunky or just striaght didn't work. So out of my frustration of a quality Wiki, I decided to build my own.

=THE PLUGIN IS IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT=
Not safe for consumption! Well, maybe a little... but you won't get much. I just started this so don't bother with it for now. Go ahead and follow the project and see when it's ready for beta usage.

== Installation ==

= Easy Installation =

Select “Add New” from the “Plugins” option in your WordPress administration panel.
Using the form, search “wiki-wiki” and click “Activate.”
You will notice the “Wiki” option appear in your WordPress administration panel.
You can then add new wikis, wiki categories or adjust settings.

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `/wiki-wiki` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
